SIMPLE PUMPING STATION by Fred Lusk
This EPANET file models a simple pumping station with two operational
pumps for the purpose of developing the system curves for one- and
two-pump operation.  Each pump is modeled as two nodes, one for 
suction and one for discharge.  Each pump also has high- and low-HGL
suction and discharge reservoirs for determining high and low static
lifts and thus high and low system curves.

This analysis uses EPANET's Time Period Simulation feature, but where
time is irrelevant.  Instead, the time increments are used to vary flows
at the pump nodes and to switch between the high and low suction
and discharge reservoirs.

The 24-hour analysis period consists of four, 6-hour scenarios.  Pump 1
runs during each scenario, starting at 0x base demand, then 1x, 2x, 3x,
4x, and finally 5x, then repeating three more times.  Pump 2 runs only
during the last two scenarios using the same flow peaking as Pump 1.
Pump demands are controlled by demand patterns Q1 and Q2.  I suggest
setting the base demand for each pump at about 1/3 of the design flow
rate for one pump.

During the first and third scenarios, the pump(s) pump from the high
suction reservoir to the low discharge reservoir (minimum static lift).
During the second and fourth scenarios, the pump(s) pump from the low
suction reservoir to the high discharge reservoir (maximum static lift).

The pipes attached to the reservoirs are ficticious pipes with L=1 ft,
d = 99 in, and C=150.  Their purpose is to connect the reservoirs to the
system and control (via Controls|Simple) which reservoirs are active.
The ficticious pipes are "sized" to ensure that they do not affect the
hydraulic results.

For a real project, edit the system configuration, pipe data, node
data, and reservoir data to suit.  For modeling a wet-well-only lift
station, the simplest approach would be to edit P2S, P3S1, and
P3S2 to be just like the reservoir pipes (i.e. very short and very big).
The more representative approach would be to connect the
downstream ends of ficticious pipes P1SH and P1SL to Node N2S,
then eliminate Pipe P2S and Node N1S.

For creating system curves for the purpose of selecting pumps,
the most important results are the heads at N3S1, N3S2, N4D1,
and N4D2.
